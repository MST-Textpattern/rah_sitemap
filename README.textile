p. Rah_sitemap is a sitemap plugin for "Textpattern CMS":http://www.textpattern.com. Easily build valid "Sitemaps.org":http://www.sitemaps.org XML(eXtensible Markup Language) sitemaps for search engines, including Google. Supports categories, sections, articles and even custom URLs. All settings can be managed from clean interface. No dive to code required.

h2. List of features

* Simple interface and options integrated to Textpattern's native preferences panel.
* Filter, include and exclude section, category and article URLs from the sitemap.
* No need to create files nor set permissions, instead of just use the plugin and eventually submit the sitemap URL to Google (via Webmaster tools) and other search engines.
* Sitemap is automatically compressed.

h2. Requirements

Rah_sitemap's minimum requirements:

* Textpattern v4.4.1 or newer.
* PHP 5.2 or newer.

h2. Installing

p. The general behavior stands: paste the plugin code to the plugin installer textarea and run the automatic setup. Then just activate the plugin and you are ready to use the sitemap.

p. You can locate rah_sitemap's user-interface panel from Textpattern's Advanced Preferences panel, Textpattern / Admin / Preferences / Advanced.

h2. Configuration

p. Todo

h2. Preferences

p. Rah_sitemap comes with number of preferences which all can be found from the "Advanced Preferences":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=Advanced_Preferences, organized under a *Sitemap* section. Rah_sitemap's preferences allow excluding sections, categories and articles from the XML sitemap. Following options will be present.

h3. Exclude categories

p. Any selected category will be excluded from the sitemap.

h3. Exclude sections

p. Works similarly to categories. Any of the selected sections will be excluded from the sitemap. The option will only effect the actual section page, but not articles published to the section.

h3. Exclude articles based on fields

p. The field can be used to exclude articles from the sitemap based on any article field and its value. The option takes a comma-separated list of @articlefield: value@ pairs. Where the field is the of the database field and the value is the field's value that will be excluded. Available fields include: @Title@, @AuthorID@, @Body@, @Excerpt@, @Category1@, @Category2@, @Section@, @Keywords@, @url_title@, @custom_1@ to @custom_10@ and @Image@.

p. Values used in the option support two wildcard characters. An underscore (@_@) matches exactly one character, and a percent sign (@%@) matches zero or more characters.

p. If you wanted to exclude articles posted to "sections":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=sections _notes_ and _private_ or by a user _mailer_, you could use the following as the setting:

bc. Section: notes, Section: private, AuthorID: mailer

h3. Additional URLs

p. Comma-separated list of additional local site URLs added to the sitemap. Note that sitemaps only allow local URLs, meaning that any URL used, needs to link to the same domain as the website. If an URL is relative and doesn't start with a HTTP or HTTPS protocol, the site's URL is prepended to the URL.

h3. Include future articles?

p. If set to Yes, articles with publishing date set to a future date, are visible in the sitemap. Please note that by default "article":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=article tag doesn't display future articles, unless its @time@ attribute is explicitly set to include @future@.

h3. Include published articles?

p. If set to Yes, published, Live, articles are visible in the sitemap. If both this option and _Include future articles?_ are set to No, no articles will be visible in the sitemap.

h3. Include expired articles?

p. If set to No, expired articles are not visible in the sitemap.

h3. Exclude sticky articles?

p. If set to Yes, "sticky":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=Write#Sticky articles are not visible in the sitemap.

h2. For developers

p. Todo.

h3. Version 1.2 - 2011/03/09

* Added: adds site URL to relative article permlinks. Basically a fix for gbp_permanent_links.

h3. Version 1.1 - 2010/10/30

* Fixed issues appearing with the installer when MySQL is in strict mode. "Thank you for reporting, Gallex":http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?pid=236637#p236637.

h3. Version 1.0 - 2010/10/29

* Slightly changed backend's installer call; only check for installing if there is no preferences available.

h3. Version 0.9 - 2010/08/25

* Fixed: now correctly parses category tags in category URLs. Thank you for "reporting":http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?pid=233619#p233619, Andreas.

h3. Version 0.8 - 2010/07/27

* Now compression level field's label now links to the correct field id.
* Now suppresses E_WARNING/E_STRICT notices in live mode caused by Textpattern's timezone code when some conditions are met (TXP 4.2.0, PHP 5.1.0+, TXP's Auto-DST feature disabled, TXP in Live mode). Error suppression will be removed when TXP version is released with fully working timezone settings.
* Now generates UNIX timestamps within the SQL query, not with PHP.
* Changed sliding panels' links (@a@ elements) into spans.

h3. Version 0.7 - 2010/05/30

* Fixed: now deleting custom url leads back to the list view, not to the editing form.
* Removed some leftover inline styles from v0.6.

h3. Version 0.6 - 2010/05/30

* Rewritten the code that generates the sitemap.
* New admin panel look.
* Now custom permlink modes and custom urls are escaped. Users can input unescaped URLs/markup from now on.
* Now custom URL list shows the full formatted URL after auto-fill instead of the user input.
* Now custom URLs that start with www. are completed with http:// protocol.
* Now all urls that do not start with either http, https, www, ftp or ftps protocol are auto-completed with the site's address.
* Custom url editor got own panel. No longer the form is above the URL list.
* Added ability to manually turn gzib compression off and change the compression level.
* Added setting to set zlib.output_compression off. "See here":http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?pid=224931#p224931, thank you for reporting superfly.
* Preferences are now trimmed during save.
* Merged @rah_sitemap_update()@ with @rah_sitemap_save()@.
* From now on all new installations have default settings defined that will automatically exclude link, file and image categories from the sitemap. This won't effect updaters.
* Changed sitemap's callback register from pre @pretext@ to callback after it (callback is now @textpattern@). Now @$pretext@ is set before the sitemap and thus more plugins might work within permlink settings and custom urls.
* When using TXP's clean URLs, requesting @/sitemap.xml.gz@ and @/sitemap.xml@ URLs will return the sitemap, not just the @/?rah_sitemap=sitemap@. This will of course require existing fully working clean urls.
